# Homework 1

This homework is about comparing analytical solution for different trajectories with what we get from numerical integration during simulation.

## How to run:

```bash
ros2 run s23_mobile_robotics hw1
```

During run `hw1` saves bag for each `config_idx` you could specify directly in code.

These ros2 bags were analyzed in [this notebook](homework1_vis.ipynb).
